# Spam Classifier

## Overview
A **machine learning model** to classify text messages as **spam** or **not spam**. This project demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning using Python.

## Features
- Input: Text message  
- Output: Spam / Not Spam  
- Preprocessing: text cleaning, vectorization  
- Model: Logistic Regression  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas / NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spam-classifier.git
cd spam-classifier
````
2.	Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
````
3.	Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook spam-classifier.ipynb
````
Future Improvements

•	Add more preprocessing steps (stopwords, stemming, lemmatization)

•	Deploy as an interactive app for real-time spam detection

•	Experiment with deep learning models for better accuracy
